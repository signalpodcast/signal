<p><strong>Orange</strong> is an anime, a manga, and a live action movie, about a 16-year old girl, Naho, who begins to receive letters from her 26-year old future self. The letters instruct her to change the future, to prevent the death of someone important to her, a boy name Kukiru.</p>
<p>But it's not as easy as it sounds. Future-Naho only knows what went wrong, not how to do it right, and the more present-Naho changes things, the less useful the letters become. She's going to have to rely on her wits, and her friends, and her love, and most importantly, she's going to have to need courage.</p>
