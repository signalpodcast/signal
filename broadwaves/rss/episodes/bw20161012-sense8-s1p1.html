<p><strong>Sense8</strong> is a Netflix original show, about eight people who start to discover they have a connection with each other. They learn that they can see through each other's eyes, and borrow each other's skills. They have become, in Sense8 mythology, a &quot;cluster&quot;.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people out to get them. Individually, they each have their own stories, so that's eight adventures for a start. But together, they form part of a bigger story, a story about what it means to be human.</p>
<p>In this episode of <strong>Broadwaves</strong>, we introduce you to Sense8, and  we do it without giving away any major spoilers - because if you haven't seen it yet, we want you to watch it.</p>
