<dd>Starring Kari Haley as Sarah Brunel.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>I think the &#x2018;verse is against me &#x2013; my idea was as neat as a bottle of 200 proof whisky that&#x2019;s been tidied up for the school concert by an immaculate mother. It was foolproof.</dd>
<dt>NARRATOR</dt>
<dd>And Miranda Thomas as Taya Ray Parsec.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Foolproof or full proof? Maybe we should send some whisky to Mr Spall to calm him down.</dd>
<dt>NARRATOR</dt>
<dd>And featuring Nick Edwards as Mr Spall.</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>

<dl><dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Bored.)</em> [&#x2026;] uploading with this wave. This is just your standard pre-settlement final check. You know the drill. Get the usual readings and keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary. The first settlers should be landing in a week so you need to be done by then. Report back once you&#x2019;re finished. That&#x2019;s all.</dd>
</dl>

<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Sarcastic.)</em> Well, that&#x2019;s certainly my idea of a fun assignment. A week on an uninhabited rock, stuck doing a bunch of readings.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Do you think we&#x2019;re being punished for the last assignment?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>It's more than likely, though if may say so, highly unfair. How were we supposed to know those seeds would cross-fertilise? Our attempt to save space by planting them next to each other was a perfectly reasonable strategy. We must always strive for more efficiency and not let these minor setbacks deter us.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>And anyway, I like jungles. They&#x2019;re wild and exciting. Way more interesting than all those boring crop fields.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Not quite so practical though, as Mr Spall pointed out.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Well, even if it is a punishment, I don&#x2019;t think this assignment&#x2019;s too bad anyway. It should be nice and peaceful, at least. <em>(Dreamily.)</em> And we can be the first to set foot on the virgin grass of a freshly terraformed moon.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>More likely the virgin dust, but I concede your point. Let&#x2019;s just get over there and get on with it then.</dd>

<p><em>FX: Instrument beep noises.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Reading off an instrument.)</em> &#x2026;Forty two point five.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>OK, that&#x2019;s the last of the initial measurements. So far, so boring. At least we&#x2019;re clear to go outside now though and have a go at breathing this fresh new air. You get the&#x2014;</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Wait, Sarah. What&#x2019;s that over there?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Where?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>There, by the group of darker rocks on the horizon.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>It&#x2019;s just a bunch of more rocks.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Keep watching them.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Shocked.)</em> They&#x2019;re moving!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Appropriately dramatic music cue&#x2026;</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Awed voice.)</em> Are they people, or animals, or&#x2026;?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>They seem to be standing upright, but they are fairly short in stature.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Well, they are far away.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Eyes rolling.)</em> Yes, I know, but even still, they don&#x2019;t seem&#x2026; human-sized.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>So, you&#x2019;re thinking what I&#x2019;m thinking?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>That they&#x2019;re&#x2026; aliens? Yeah, I guess I am. I can&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;m saying it, but&#x2026;</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Excitedly.)</em> Let&#x2019;s go and try to communicate with them!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Hold your horses, Ms enthusiastic! They might be dangerous. We should observe them some more first.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Should we contact Mr Spall?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>No, let&#x2019;s hold off on that until we know more. You know what he&#x2019;s like; he&#x2019;d never believe us anyway. We need to collect more data first; maybe get closer, take a capture.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Oh, look, there&#x2019;s a bigger one with the group now. I think that one&#x2019;s the leader. Do you think it&#x2019;s a he or a she?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>It could be neither. Or both&#x2026; It seems to be organising the others into a special formation. I think they are enacting a kind of ritual. I wonder what it is?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>We could be the first humans ever to witness an alien wedding!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>There&#x2019;s definitely some kind of pattern to how they&#x2019;re moving now. There&#x2019;s two groups and they seem to be staying in two defined areas. The larger one seems to be staying off to one side. It&#x2019;s almost like we&#x2019;re watching a&#x2026; <em>(Starting to realise.)</em>&#x2026;</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Still blissfully unaware.)</em> It&#x2019;s almost like we&#x2019;re watching little alien children playing alien dodgeball with their alien teacher.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Realises how stupid they&#x2019;ve been.)</em> Yeah, just cut out one little word three times and I think you&#x2019;ve got it. <em>(Tired and resigned.)</em> Taya Ray, play Mr Spall&#x2019;s instructions again. <em>(Emphasis.)</em> From the beginning.</dd>

<dl><dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Bored.)</em> Brunel, Parsec. Listen up. This next assignment is so easy that even you shouldn&#x2019;t mess it up. I&#x2019;ve already spent enough time recently trying to explain away your mishaps to the Powers That Be. Just try to follow my instructions properly this time, all right? Once you&#x2019;ve stocked up on the necessary supplies, head out to the fourth moon and set up base at the coordinates I&#x2019;m uploading with this wave. This is just your standard pre-settlement final check. You know the drill. Get the usual readings and keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary. The first settlers should be landing in a week so you need to be done by then. Report back once you&#x2019;re finished. That&#x2019;s all.</dd>

<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Starts to get it now.)</em> Oh, I&#x2019;m guessing we&#x2019;re not on the fourth then?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Nope.</dd>
