<dd>Starring Kari Haley as Sarah Brunel.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Optimistically.)</em> We&#x2019;re definitely on the up and up now. Mr Spall wants to speak with us face to face about this assignment. Something about it being top secret!</dd>
<dt>NARRATOR</dt>
<dd>And Miranda Thomas as Taya Ray Parsec.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Oooh, I wonder what it could be? Maybe we&#x2019;ll be getting fancy disguises and going under cover!</dd>
<dt>NARRATOR</dt>
<dd>And featuring Nick Edwards as Mr Spall.</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>Now I&#x2019;m counting on you two to be discreet on this one. Don&#x2019;t let me down!</dd>

<hr>
<p><em>Location: General office noises in the background and then the door closes, shutting the noises out.</em></p>


<dl><dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>Right, pull up a pew.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Chairs scraping.</em></p>


<dl><dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>I wanted to bring you in for this briefing because we&#x2019;ve got to keep this particular assignment rather hush-hush. There&#x2019;s been a bit of an unexplained terraforming event at one of our recent sites &#x2013; the location and further details are in your briefing pack. You need to go in and find out what went wrong. Discretion is key for this one. Don&#x2019;t talk about this with anyone, all right?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>You&#x2019;ve got it, Mr Spall.</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>You know how the public gets when stuff like this gets leaked. They start panicking about the sky falling in or some such nonsense.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>You can trust us, Mr Spall.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>And we sure appreciate you choosing us for this important assignment.</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>Yeah, well, I get the feeling that you two are pretty good at finding creative ways to cover up mistakes. Only difference is, this time you aren&#x2019;t the ones who made the mistakes in the first place&#x2026;</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Sound of van driving up over following line.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Enthusiastically.)</em> Here we are. I can&#x2019;t wait to see it!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Sound of van door opening over following line.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Resigned.)</em> I knew you&#x2019;d say that.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>As door opens, we hear rainforest noises, including some prominent croaking of frogs.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Oh, I love it! It&#x2019;s awesome!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Not convinced.)</em> I guess so.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Why oh why are supposed to fix this? It ain&#x2019;t broke! Look at the vines and the lilies. And the frogs! They obviously like it just as it is. And the water looks so inviting!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>But Taya Ray, <em>(Beat.)</em> The water is purple!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>(Beat.)</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Come on, let&#x2019;s get suited up. Whatever is colouring the water could be dangerous. <em>(Slightly mocking.)</em> You wanted to go undercover for this top secret assignment? I guess this is your chance. Don&#x2019;t forget your mask.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Rustling of protective clothing being put on over the following lines.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>I don&#x2019;t know why you&#x2019;re so grumpy. <em>(Brightly.)</em> We get to go play detectives!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>I&#x2019;m grumpy because I thought we were going to be investigating something slightly more serious than a purple lagoon!</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Well, maybe we&#x2019;ll get the chance to do that if we solve the mystery of the purple lagoon!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Sarcastic.)</em> You know, I think there must be something in the water because that actually sounded somewhat sensible.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Ha ha.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Well, come on then, masks on and into the fray!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Sounds of masks being put on.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Slightly muffled, speaking through mask.)</em> Ready?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Slightly muffled, speaking through mask.)</em> Yep. Let&#x2019;s do this!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Musical cue to indicate passing of time.</em></p>

<p><em>Splashes as Sarah and Taya Ray walk towards the bank.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Well, after several back-breaking hours of work, what do we know?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Matter-of-factly.)</em> It&#x2019;s definitely not toxic and it&#x2019;s stained my fingers brown.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Sarcastically.)</em> Excellent deduction, Detective Parsec. I&#x2019;ll let Mr Spall know at once. I&#x2019;m sure when the settlers arrive next week, they&#x2019;ll be reassured to know they have a convenient non-toxic tanning bath of mysterious origin in their backyard.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Well, if I were a settler here, I&#x2019;d be happy with that!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Oh, yes, I forgot. You are of course the one who thought it would be fun to live in Squirrel World, so perhaps we shouldn&#x2019;t be trusting your judgment on what makes for an inhabitable world!</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>If only the frogs could talk!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Hesitating.)</em> Yes?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Maybe they know what&#x2019;s turned the water purple.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Sarcastically.)</em> Yes, maybe they know the cause and only the lack of a common language is preventing them communicating it with us.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Blissfully unaware of the sarcasm directed at her.)</em> I&#x2019;m going to try to capture one!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>What, you want to interview it?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>No, silly, I want to see if it looks healthy. Maybe the purple water takes a while before it has an effect on living creatures?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Ok, now you&#x2019;re scaring me &#x2013; that&#x2019;s twice you&#x2019;ve made sense in a very short space of time.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Splashes over the following as Taya Ray wades back into the water.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(From a distance.)</em> Come here, little froggie, if I can just&#x2026;</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Careful, you don&#x2019;t want to&#x2014;</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Big splash.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Beat.)</em> &#x2014;fall. <em>(Beat.)</em> Taya Ray, are you ok?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(From a distance, coughing and spluttering.)</em> I landed on, um, something metal.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Sound of container being pulled out of the water.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(From a distance.) It&#x2019;s some kind of container.</em></dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Bring it over here and let&#x2019;s have a look at it.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Taya Ray splashes towards the bank.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Well, would you look at that!</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>At what? I can&#x2019;t see. Everything&#x2019;s gone purple&#x2026;</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>It&#x2019;s a container of dye.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>What colour dye?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Beat.)</em> I&#x2019;m going to be charitable and let that pass since you are wet and purple right now, ooh, and rapidly turning brown! It&#x2019;s an <em>empty</em> container of <em>purple</em> dye.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Ohhhh! Yay! Mystery solved!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Who would have guessed it? <em>(Mocking, in grand tones.) The thing that was dying the water purple was&#x2026; purple dye!</em></dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>And who would have thought that falling on my face would be the key to solving the case!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Yeah, way to take one for the team, Taya Ray! Hmm...</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Turning over metal can, water runs out.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Well, that's a relief. It <em>is</em> non-toxic. Just a vegetable-based dye concentrate. The can must have been dropped by a team some time back and has only now sprung a leak. The dye should break down and disperse harmlessly in a few weeks.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>A few <em>weeks</em>?!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Come on, let&#x2019;s get back to the van and let Mr Spall know.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Footsteps/squelches as they head back to the van, over the following lines.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>And then I think maybe you&#x2019;d like to take a bath?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>And in some water-coloured water this time, please.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Clicks/beeps as Sarah reaches in through the window of the van to call Mr Spall on the com.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Mr Spall. Brunel here. Do you copy?</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Over com.)</em> Ah, Brunel. Wasn&#x2019;t expecting to hear from you so soon. Have you discovered the cause of our, um, little situation?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>We certainly have. Nothing sinister at work here. We had a touch of luck in our investigations and came across the answer quite by chance.</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Over com.)</em> Good, good. You two always do seem to land on your feet!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Brightly.)</em> Not always, Mr Spall!</dd>
