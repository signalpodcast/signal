<dd><em>(Drowsily, waking up from a dream.)</em> But where will the squirrels live?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(In a very good mood for once.)</em> Mornin&#x2019;, sleepy head.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Did I fall asleep?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>I hope so, otherwise you&#x2019;re going to have to come up with a very good explanation for that drool.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Oh, ugh. Sorry. You know, I had the strangest dream! I dreamt we left the fridge off at Black Rock and there was some nitro-10 in it, which exploded and ended up fixing the terraforming problem.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Playing along.)</em> And we became millionaires, huh?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Yeah, it was a nice dream. <em>(Beat.)</em> What?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Taya Ray. <em>(Beat.)</em> That wasn&#x2019;t a dream!</dd>

<dd>Starring Kari Haley as Sarah Brunel.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Can life get any better? I&#x2019;d say I was on cloud nine, but, oh look, there are no clouds over Black Rock today! Looks like summer has come at last! Someone must have fixed the terraforming problem!</dd>
<dt>NARRATOR</dt>
<dd>And Miranda Thomas as Taya Ray Parsec.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>And that someone must have been us! Hah! We are the mighty terraformers!</dd>
<dt>NARRATOR</dt>

<p><em>Location: Shuttle.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Slightly hyper and very cheerful.)</em> Oh, isn&#x2019;t that a sight! Doesn&#x2019;t Black Rock look beautiful from up here?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Similarly hyper and on top of the world.)</em> I think we&#x2019;re gonna need a new name for this moon! Green Rock maybe! Or Teeming-With-Abundant-Life-Rock!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>All credit, and all credits, to us. We did an incredible job!</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>And now for the ceremony and the prize! A million credits, I can hardly believe it!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>It&#x2019;s one hell of a bonus, that&#x2019;s for sure.</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(From the back of the shuttle, finding all this exuberance somewhat painful and groaning to himself.)</em> Urrggh, no.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Faking it.)</em> Did you hear something, Taya Ray?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Playing along.)</em> I think that was the sound of some very sour grapes.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>I think you might be right.</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Calling from the back of the shuttle, very despondent.)</em> Will you two just stop going on and on about your triumph! Isn&#x2019;t it enough that I have to come to the ceremony? Do you have to rub it in now as well?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Oh, I think we do!</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>I know we do!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Musical cue to indicate passing of time. Location: Outside on Black Rock. Enough time has passed for the planet to be transformed into a leafy paradise, teeming with birds and animals.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Now, this is a little different from the last time we were here!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Footsteps of someone walking up over the next line.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Just a little! Things have grown so quickly. Oh, look at that bird! I can hardly believe it&#x2019;s the same place!</dd>
<dt>HECUBA KALI</dt>
<dd><em>(Flashheart-esque, as ever.)</em> Ah, the heroes of the hour, I presume!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Hecuba Kali! We&#x2019;re so excited that you could make it! <em>(Slightly fangirl-ish.)</em> Um, I&#x2019;m Sarah Brunel.</dd>
<dt>HECUBA KALI</dt>
<dd>Yes, I remember when I assigned you two to work together. I always knew you would do great things.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>I&#x2019;m Taya Ray Parsec.</dd>
<dt>HECUBA KALI</dt>
<dd>You are? I remember you differently. <em>(Beat.)</em> Anyway, I see some of my adoring fans over there and I mustn&#x2019;t disappoint them, but we&#x2019;ll catch up later. See you on stage!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Footsteps as Hecuba Kali walks away.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Oh, this just gets better and better! Now Hecuba Kali wants to be seen with us! Come on, let&#x2019;s get over to the stage. We don&#x2019;t want to keep Mr Spall waiting!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Footsteps over the next line as they walk off towards the stage. Taya Ray&#x2019;s voice fades out slightly as they walk away.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>What did she mean, Sarah? &#x201C;I remember you differently&#x201D;?</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Musical cue to indicate passing of time. Location: Outdoor stage on Black Rock. Mr Spall is talking through a microphone. All other lines in this section are also spoken through a microphone.</em></p>


<dl><dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Not enjoying this at all.)</em> And so it gives me great&#x2026; pleasure&#x2026; to introduce to you the two finest terraformers I have ever had the privilege of working with&#x2026; Sarah Brunel and Taya Ray Parsec!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Cheering and applause.</em></p>


<dl><dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>And to make the presentation, we have another terraforming great, Hecuba Kali!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>More cheering and applause.</em></p>


<dl><dt>HECUBA KALI</dt>
<dd>Thank you, thank you. As much as I know my fans would like it to be different, this day is not about me. This day is about celebrating the exploits of the two terraformers who have solved the Black Rock mystery! I have in my hands a framed statement from the Alliance Terraforming Cooperation showing the transfer of one million credits into your accounts. Everyone, join with me in congratulating Sarah Brunel and Taya Ray Parsec!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Cheering and applause over the next two lines.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Thank you, thanks very much.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Thank you!</dd>
<dt>HECUBA KALI</dt>
<dd>So, now you&#x2019;re filthy rich, are you going to retire?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Um, well, we thought about that, but actually we&#x2019;d like to stay in the game for a while.</dd>
<dt>HECUBA KALI</dt>
<dd>That&#x2019;s what I like to see! Once a terraformer, always a terraformer! But you could have the pick of the best jobs now. What do you want to do?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Well, we decided there&#x2019;s one job we&#x2019;d like to try for a couple of weeks, just for a bit of fun.</dd>
<dt>HECUBA KALI</dt>
<dd>That sounds intriguing, but I have a feeling you&#x2019;re not going to give us any more details.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>It&#x2019;s kind of a surprise.</dd>
<dt>HECUBA KALI</dt>
<dd>I guess we&#x2019;ll all have to wonder what that means. And in the meantime, let&#x2019;s give it up for our terraforming heroes!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Cheering and applause plus a band which plays everyone off stage. Then this fades, or we use our usual musical cue to indicate passing of time, whichever sounds best.</em>
<em>Location: Office.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Is it time? I think it&#x2019;s time.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Oh, I think we&#x2019;ve left him to stew long enough. Let&#x2019;s find out what&#x2019;s going on.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Beeps as Sarah uses com.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Spall, do you copy? Come in, Spall.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>(Beat.)</em></p>


<dl><dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Over com. Very, very flustered.)</em> Um, yes, I copy, Miss Brunel. <em>(Aside, whispering.)</em> Get off me, stop it. No, wait, catch it, it&#x2019;s going to&#x2026; <em>(Louder again, blustering.)</em> Yes, we&#x2019;re here. All&#x2019;s well.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Well, you just keep at it, Spall. Those squirrels won&#x2019;t catch themselves!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Beeps as Taya Ray turns off com.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>I think I&#x2019;m going to like this new job!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Clink-clink of glasses raised in a toast.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Me too!</dd>
