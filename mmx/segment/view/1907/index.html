<dd>Starring Kari Haley as Sarah Brunel.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Well, it&#x2019;s nice to be in Mr Spall&#x2019;s good books for a change. Who knew that all it would take was a little arson and then being on hand to pull off a dramatic rescue at the last minute?</dd>
<dt>NARRATOR</dt>
<dd>And Miranda Thomas as Taya Ray Parsec.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>All the same, I think I&#x2019;m going to be sticking to cold drinks for a while. Probably safer all round.</dd>
<dt>NARRATOR</dt>
<dd>And featuring Nick Edwards as Mr Spall.</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>I think I misjudged you two, you know? <em>(Getting emotional.)</em> You ran into fire for me! I won&#x2019;t forget that!</dd>

<dd>Episode number 18 &#x2013; The Cup of Truth</dd>

<hr>
<p><em>Location: Classroom. General classroom noises in the background, students chatting quietly, etc, for the whole scene. In the foreground, Sarah is writing on the blackboard.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Right, that should be enough questions to keep them out of mischief for a while.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Writing on blackboard stops.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Are we supposed to know the answers to these questions?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Only if we want to, you know, actually be able to do our jobs properly. Please don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;ve forgotten all this stuff about water purification! It&#x2019;s kind of important! Settlers are fussy that way, you see, they tend to expect their lakes and rivers to be <em>not</em> poisonous.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>It&#x2019;s just so long since we&#x2019;ve done some actual terraforming. And all these words look so alike &#x2013; sulphate, sulphide, sulphone, sulphur, sultana. How are you supposed to keep them straight?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Piling on the sarcasm.)</em> Well, you have this thing called a <em>brainpan</em>, Taya Ray, and there&#x2019;s supposed to be something in it called a <em>brain</em>. You use this <em>brain</em> to <em>remember</em> things.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Slightly haughty.)</em> I prefer to use my brain to remember nice things. I think the space that used to hold the water purification stuff is otherwise occupied now, thank you very much.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Normally that would not bode well for the practical you&#x2019;ll be demonstrating later this morning, but since Mr Spall has promised to stick by your side as you prepare, I think we&#x2019;ll be ok. And talk of the supervisor, here he comes.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Door opens.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Quiet voice to Taya Ray)</em> Look lively! <em>(Normal voice, with forced cheerfulness.)</em> Ah, Mr Spall, so glad you could join us!</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Still some lingering euphoria after his brush with death.)</em> As am I, Brunel, as am I! And how are my two favourite terraformers today then?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Through gritted teeth.)</em> Looking forward to having your help to set up the water purification practical, Mr Spall!</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>Jolly good. I must say I&#x2019;m looking forward to it too. It&#x2019;s been a while since I&#x2019;ve got my hands dirty and done some grass-roots terraforming, so to speak. Well, shall we go?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Brightly.)</em> You two have fun now!</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Door closes.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(To herself.)</em> I&#x2019;m not sure who I pity more.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Musical cue to indicate passing of time.</em></p>

<p><em>Location: Laboratory. Taya Ray and Mr Spall are setting up the practical.</em></p>


<dl><dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Trying to sound confident, but really having no clue what he&#x2019;s talking about.)</em> No, it&#x2019;s definitely a sulphate that you need.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Equally clueless, but less confident.)</em> If you say so, Mr Spall.</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Blustering.)</em> Well, you never really forget the basics of terraforming, Parsec. Once a terraformer, always a terraformer, I say. I may wear a suit now and sit in an office, but I haven&#x2019;t forgotten my humble beginnings. There we go.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Sound of liquid being poured into other liquid overlaps with last three words of previous line. Then the sound of bubbling.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Innocently, unsure.)</em> Is it meant to bubble like that?</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Trying to cover his ignorance.)</em> Of course, it&#x2019;s all part of the, um, you know, process.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Bubbling stops.</em></p>


<dl><dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>There we are. It must be ready now. Would you like a glass?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Not quite convinced.)</em> No, it&#x2019;s all right, you go first, Mr Spall.</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>All righty.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Sound of drinking.</em></p>


<dl><dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>Ooh, lovely! Very refreshing. Good job, well done, I&#x2019;d say. Here, try some.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Slightly more convinced.)</em> Uh, ok.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Sound of drinking.</em></p>


<dl><dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Completely convinced.)</em> Oh, you&#x2019;re right! It&#x2019;s very good.</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd>I think I might have another.</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>Yes, why not?</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Musical cue to indicate passing of time.</em></p>

<p><em>Door opens, overlapping with Sarah&#x2019;s line. Footsteps as the students come into the lab.</em></p>


<dl><dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>Ok, come this way, class. As you can see, Mr Spall and Miss Parsec have prepared a demonstration on water purification techniques for us and I think&#x2014;<em>(Cuts herself off mid-sentence, then a shocked beat.)</em> Mr Spall!</dd>
<dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Very drunk.)</em> Yes, Brusec? <em>Hic.</em> I mean, Parnel? I mean, Brunel?</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Incredulously.)</em> What have you been doing in here?</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Also very drunk.)</em> We made water! You should try some, it&#x2019;s, <em>hic</em>, very good!</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd>I can see that!</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd>In fact, it&#x2019;s so good, I think I&#x2019;ll give up tea and just drink this for the rest of my life. Which is good really since my kettle blew up last week and all.</dd>
<dt>SARAH</dt>
<dd><em>(Realising the danger, low voice, urgently.)</em> Taya Ray, stop talking!</dd>
<dt>TAYA RAY</dt>
<dd><em>(Oblivious.)</em> It was such a nice kettle. Till it blew up the dorm, I mean. That wasn&#x2019;t very nice of it.</dd>
</dl>


<p><em>Beat.</em></p>


<dl><dt>MR SPALL</dt>
<dd><em>(Suddenly somewhat sobered up...)</em> <em>WHAT</em> did you just say?!</dd>
